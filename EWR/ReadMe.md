<h1>Introduction</h1>
<span>I made this script at work to automatically update a users password.</span><br />
<span>Some information is removed / hidden for security reasons</span><br />
<span>Grabs a list of the current users ids and passwords. Then logs in for each user and updates their passwords in the dedicated system.</span><br />

<h1>How to use</h1>
<span>Simply press run in VS Code and the process will begin!</span><br />
<span>Takes about 3 minutes to update at the moment. Depends on how many active users there are.</span><br /><br /><br />
<span>Note: I can not have a detailed description of how to setup the query part of this script for security reasons so this will obviously not work for anyone else</span><br />
